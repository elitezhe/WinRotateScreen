# WinRotateScreen
Description: Rotate Screen on Windows Platform.

## Why I do this?
I have a windows tablet with Win8 OS(Factory installed)

After updated to Win10 x86, the tablet's Gravity Sensor driver does not fit in Win10. Consequently, when I put the tablet Horizontally, the screen is Vertical.
